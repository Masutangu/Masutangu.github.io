# Chapter 1. UNIX System Overview

## 1.1. Introduction

* All operating systems provide services for programs they run. Typical services include executing a new program, opening a file, reading a file, allocating a region of memory, getting the current time of day, and so on.

## 1.2. UNIX Architecture

* An operating system can be defined as the software that controls the hardware resources of the computer and provides an environment under which programs can run. Generally, we call this software the **kernel**.
* The interface to the kernel is a layer of software called the **system calls**. Libraries of common functions are built on top of the system call interface, but applications are free to use both. The shell is a special application that provides an interface for running other applications.

## 1.3. Logging In

* When we log in to a UNIX system, we enter our login name, followed by our password. The system then looks up our login name in its password file, usually the file /etc/passwd which composed of seven colon-separated fields: the login name, encrypted password, numeric user ID (205), numeric group ID (105), a comment field, home directory (/home/sar), and shell program (/bin/ksh).

## 1.4. Files and Directories

* The UNIX file system is a hierarchical arrangement of directories and files. 
* Most implementations of UNIX file systems don't store attributes in the directory entries themselves, because of the difficulty of keeping them in synch when a file has multiple hard links.

## 1.5. Input and Output

* File descriptors are normally small non-negative integers that the kernel uses to identify the files being accessed by a particular process.
* By convention, all shells open three descriptors whenever a new program is run: **standard input**, **standard output**, and **standard error**.
* Unbuffered I/O is provided by the functions **open**, **read**, **write**, **lseek**, and **close**. These functions all work with file descriptors.
* The <unistd.h> header and the two constants **STDIN_FILENO** and **STDOUT_FILENO** are part of the POSIX standard
* The standard I/O functions provide a buffered interface to the unbuffered I/O functions. Using standard I/O prevents us from having to worry about choosing optimal buffer sizes, such as the BUFFSIZE constant. Another advantage of using the standard I/O functions is that they simplify dealing with lines of input. The standard I/O constants stdin and stdout are defined in the <stdio.h> header and refer to the standard input and standard output.

## 1.6. Programs and Processes

* A program is an executable file residing on disk in a directory. A program is read into memory and is executed by the kernel as a result of one of the six **exec** functions.
* The UNIX System guarantees that every process has a unique numeric identifier called the process ID. The process ID is always a non-negative integer.
* There are three primary functions for process control: fork, exec, and waitpid.
* All the threads within a process share the same **address space**, **file descriptors**, **stacks**, and **process-related attributes**. Because they can access the same memory, the threads need to synchronize access to shared data among themselves to avoid inconsistencies.
* Threads are identified by IDs, however, are **local to a process**.

## 1.7. Error Handling

* There are two rules to be aware of with respect to errno. First, its value is never cleared by a routine if an error does not occur. Therefore, we should examine its value only when the return value from a function indicates that an error occurred. Second, the value of errno is never set to 0 by any of the functions, and none of the constants defined in <errno.h> has a value of 0.
* Resource-related nonfatal errors include EAGAIN, ENFILE, ENOBUFS, ENOLCK, ENOSPC, ENOSR, EWOULDBLOCK, and sometimes ENOMEM. EBUSY can be treated as a nonfatal error when it indicates that a shared resource is in use. Sometimes, EINTR can be treated as a nonfatal error when it interrupts a slow system call. The typical recovery action for a resource-related nonfatal error is to delay a little and try again later.

## 1.8. User Identification

* The user ID from our entry in the password file is a numeric value that identifies us to the system.
* Groups are normally used to collect users together into projects or departments. This allows the sharing of resources, such as files, among members of the same group.
* There is also a group file that maps group names into numeric group IDs. The group file is usually /etc/group.
* Early UNIX systems used 16-bit integers to represent user and group IDs. Contemporary UNIX systems use 32- bit integers.

## 1.9. Signals

* Signals are a technique used to notify a process that some condition has occurred.
* The process has three choices for dealing with the signal.
    * Ignore the signal. This option isn't recommended for signals that denote a hardware exception, such as dividing by zero or referencing memory outside the address space of the process, as the results are undefined.
    * Let the default action occur. For a divide-by-zero condition, the default is to terminate the process.
    * Provide a function that is called when the signal occurs (this is called "catching" the signal). By providing a function of our own, we'll know when the signal occurs and we can handle it as we wish.

* We have to be the owner of the other process (or the superuser) to be able to send it a signal.

1.10. Time Values

* UNIX systems have maintained two different time values:
    * Calendar time. This value counts the number of seconds since the Epoch: 00:00:00 January 1, 1970, Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). These time values are used to record the time when a file was last modified, for example.
        The primitive system data type time_t holds these time values.
    * Process time. This is also called CPU time and measures the central processor resources used by a process. Process time is measured in clock ticks, which have historically been 50, 60, or 100 ticks per second.
        The primitive system data type clock_t holds these time values. 
        
* When we measure the execution time of a process, as in Section 3.9, we'll see that the UNIX System maintains three values for a process:
    * Clock time
    * User CPU time
    * System CPU time

    The clock time, sometimes called wall clock time, is the amount of time the process takes to run, and its value depends on the number of other processes being run on the system. The user CPU time is the CPU time attributed to user instructions. The system CPU time is the CPU time attributed to the kernel when it executes on behalf of the process. 

## 1.11. System Calls and Library Functions

* All operating systems provide service points through which programs request services from the kernel. All implementations of the UNIX System provide a well-defined, limited number of entry points directly into the kernel called system calls.
* The system call interface's definition is in the C language, regardless of the actual implementation technique used on any given system to invoke a system call.

# Chapter 2. UNIX Standardization and Implementations

## 2.5. Limits
* Two types of limits are needed:
    * Compile-time limits (e.g., what's the largest value of a short integer?)
    * Runtime limits (e.g., how many characters in a filename?)
    Compile-time limits can be defined in headers that any program can include at compile time. But runtime limits require the process to call a function to obtain the value of the limit.

* Additionally, some limits can be fixed on a given implementation—and could therefore be defined statically in a header—yet vary on another implementation and would require a runtime function call.
* To solve these problems, three types of limits are provided:
    * Compile-time limits (headers)
    * Runtime limits that are not associated with a file or directory (the sysconf function)
    * Runtime limits that are associated with a file or a directory (the pathconf and fpathconf functions)

* All the limits defined by ISO C are compile-time limits that are defined in the file <limits.h>. 
    *  ISO C defines the constant FOPEN_MAX, the minimum number of standard I/O streams that the implementation guarantees can be open at once. This value is in the <stdio.h> header, and its minimum value is 8. The POSIX.1 value STREAM_MAX, if defined, must have the same value as FOPEN_MAX.
    * ISO C also defines the constant TMP_MAX in <stdio.h>. It is the maximum number of unique filenames generated by the tmpnam function.

* sysconf / pathconf / fpathconf
    * All three functions return –1 and set errno to EINVAL if the name isn't one of the appropriate constants. The third column in Figures 2.10 and 2.11 lists the limit constants we'll deal with throughout the rest of this book.
    * Some names can return either the value of the variable (a return value 0) or an indication that the value is indeterminate. An indeterminate value is indicated by returning –1 and not changing the value of errno.
    * The value returned for _SC_CLK_TCK is the number of clock ticks per second, for use with the return values from the times function (Section 8.16).
