# C++

C++ occupies an interesting space among languages: it is built on the foundation of C, incorporating object-orientation ideas from Simula; standardized by ISO; and designed with the mantras **“you don’t pay for what you don’t use”** and **“support user-defined and built-in types equally well.”** One of its greatest contributions to software is its pervasive generic programming techniques, exemplified in its Standard Template Library.  

## Design Decisions
Bjarne Stroustrup: The problems I was addressing related to operating system design, networking, and simulation. I—and my colleagues— needed a language that could express program organization as could be done in Simula (that’s what people tend to call object-oriented programming), but also write efficient low-level code, as could be done in C. 

In particular, C’s type system was informal and weakly enforced (as Dennis Ritchie said, “C is a strongly typed, weakly checked language”).
